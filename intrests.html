           <img src="img/cooking.png" class="blog-image" alt="">
           <p class="project-overview">I just love cooking! It's not just about making food; it's like a fun adventure in the kitchen. I enjoy trying out new recipes and playing with different flavors. Whether it's whipping up a quick snack or spending hours on a special dish, I find it super satisfying. The best part is sharing the tasty results with friends and family. Cooking is my way of being creative, and every meal is a little masterpiece on a plate.</p>
           
           <h1 class="blog-title">SPENDING TIME</h1> 
           <img src="img/friends.png" class="blog-image" alt="">
           <p class="project-overview">Spending time with my family and friends is the best part of my day! Whether we're sharing a meal, laughing together, or just chilling out, those moments mean everything to me. It's like a warm hug for my heart. I love making memories, be it through a simple get-together or a special celebration. No matter what we're doing, being with the people I care about brings so much joy and makes life awesome. It's these moments that make everything feel just right.</p>

           <h1 class="blog-title">Games</h1> 
           <img src="img/games.png" class="blog-image" alt="">
           <p class="project-overview">Games are my go-to source of fun and excitement! Whether it's playing video games or sitting around a table for board games, I love the thrill and challenge they bring. It's not just about winning; it's the laughter, strategy, and good times that make gaming special for me. From racing cars on a screen to rolling dice on a board, every game is a new adventure. It's a great way to unwind, have a blast with friends, and sometimes even sneak in a little friendly competition. Games bring out the playful side of me and make ordinary days extraordinary.</p>
