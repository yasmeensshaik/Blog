           <p class="project-overview">This project focuses on the development of a drowsiness detection system aimed at enhancing road safety. With the alarming rise in drowsy driving incidents leading to accidents, the implementation of an efficient monitoring system becomes crucial. The proposed system employs advanced computer vision techniques, utilizing a camera to continuously analyze facial features and eye movements of the driver in real-time. Machine learning algorithms are employed to detect signs of drowsiness, such as drooping eyelids and prolonged periods of eye closure. The system provides timely alerts or warnings to the driver through visual or auditory cues, aiming to mitigate the risk of accidents caused by driver fatigue. This innovative approach not only contributes to road safety but also demonstrates the potential of integrating technology to address critical issues in transportation.</p>

       <p class="project-overview">Image Deconvolution Project focuses on enhancing the clarity of images captured in low-light or suboptimal conditions for improved drowsiness detection. Utilizing advanced image deconvolution techniques, the project aims to mitigate the impact of blurriness and noise inherent in images taken under challenging circumstances. By employing algorithms that reverse the effects of convolution, the system enhances the visibility of critical facial features and eye movements essential for accurate drowsiness detection. This innovative approach utilizes computer vision and image processing methodologies to refine image quality, ensuring that subsequent drowsiness detection algorithms operate on clearer and more accurate input data. The project addresses a critical aspect of drowsiness detection by improving the reliability of image analysis, contributing to more effective and precise monitoring systems for enhanced safety in various applications, including driver monitoring and surveillance.</p>
